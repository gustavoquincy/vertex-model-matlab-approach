This is another way that I am currently capable of for simulating the decentralized signaling systems. The more I did in the this way the more I realized that there was an innate contradition between how we operate arrays and how we want the given patch of cells to evolve. 

There's certainly a form of linearity for traversing an array, namely we operate on each member in an array in a linear fashion.

For a patch of cells to signal and evolve, we(I) need to devise a way, a different paradigm of programming. Luckily there are alternative ways of programming.

Almost forget to mention that you probably wanna go for `main.m` first to get a whole view of how these pieces of codes are assembled.
